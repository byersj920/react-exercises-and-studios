                <li>The first version of DnD was published in 1974 by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson.</li>
                <li>Magic the Gathering, the first trading card game, was designed by Richard Garfield.
                    He actually created Magic because he wanted something to play with his friends during break time
                    in his DnD sessions. The world and lore of DnD was a huge inspiration for the card game. As well
